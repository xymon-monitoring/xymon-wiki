# xymon-wiki

Collaborative knowledge space maintained by the community.  
Contains HOWTOs, troubleshooting notes, deployment examples, platform-specific information, and practical experience not tied to a specific release.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a central, searchable entry point for operational and technical knowledge related to the Xymon ecosystem.  
The objective is to reduce repetition and avoid divergent or contradictory guidance across scattered threads.

---

## Primary Repositories

- **Xymon Core**
  https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/xymon  
  Main source code, active development, server and client components.

- **SVN Mirror (Historical Reference)**
  https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/xymon-svn-mirror  
  Preserved legacy history.

- **Windows / PowerShell Client**
  https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/xymon-client-powershell  
  Modern client implementation for Windows environments.

- **xymon-wiki (this repository)**
  https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/xymon-wiki  
  Search-engine indexable documentation and knowledge base, published as a website.

- **xymon-problem (non-code / operational topics - needs cleanup)**
  (placeholder) https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/xymon-problem  
  Repository intended for issues/topics that are not strictly code problems. Requires cleanup.

---

## Work Tracking

- **Issues (main tracker)**
  https://github.com/xymon-monitoring/xymon/issues  
  Structured tracking of active work, bug reports, design discussions, and tasks.  
  Key topics may be pinned to remain visible.

- **Index Issue (recommended)**
  A single pinned "index" issue can be used to track and link to the current key topics,
  so context stays discoverable and consistent over time.

- **Mailing List**
  Long-form, asynchronous discussions and historical archive.  
  The wiki should be preferred for stable, repeatable answers to reduce reposting.

---

## Communication Channels

- **Telegram**
  Used for operational coordination and rapid exchanges (easy API/bots).

- **Signal**
  Used for secure communications when confidentiality is required (high security).

(Some channel names are reserved for potential future use in a private repository.)
